# Project_Address_Book

Description:

Address Book is a console-based application written in C to manage personal or professional contact information efficiently. It enables users to:

  1.Add new contacts

  2.Search existing contacts

  3.Update contact information

  4.Delete contacts from the record

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of advanced C programming concepts, such as function pointers, file handling, and modular design. The application maintains contact data persistently using file storage and operates entirely through standard input/output, making it easy to use and platform-independent.

Features:

  ➕ Add Contacts: Enter name, phone number, and email to store a new contact.

  🔍 Search Contacts: Find a contact by name or phone number.

  ✏️ Update Contact: Modify existing contact details.

  🗑️ Delete Contact: Remove a contact from the address book.

  💾 File Handling: Contact data is saved in a text file for persistence.

  🧠 Function Pointers: Used for dynamic function calling and modular design.

  📂 Modular Code: Well-organized code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.

  📑 Validated Input: Ensures correct format for phone numbers and email addresses.

  🗂️ Sorted Records: Contacts are stored and can be viewed in alphabetical order.

Learning Objectives:

This project helps you strengthen your understanding of:

  Structured programming in C

  Handling user input through menus

  Reading/writing structured data to files

  Using function pointers for modular operations
